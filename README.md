# bootstrap

A temporary fork of the [SCClassLibrary directory](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/tree/develop/SCClassLibrary)
within [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), for bootstrapping Hadron development.

This is *not* intended for production use. Early development of Hadron needs a simpler class library than
what is currently checked in. Rather than try to "boil the ocean" and get Hadron to compile the entire
class library monolithically, we'll use copies of some files, heavily edited, to get core functionality solid
before expanding out to support the production library.

To keep this repository light I've not copied the histories of these files. Credit is due to the
[original authors](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/AUTHORS), and the
SuperCollider repository has the authoritative commit history there.
